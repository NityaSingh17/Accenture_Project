# Accenture_Project
A virtual internship project done for Accenture North America. 
Data analysis for a social media company named "SOCIAL BUZZ" which needed some insights about how their content market is doing. 
So, I have cleaned the data, applied some functions for data augmentation on "Excel" and at last created a dashboard for the same on "Power BI".
